* Accessible design by default - color contrast, encouraging alt-text for visual elements,
decoration for links.
* No unnecessary JavaScript or external resources like web fonts.
* No trackers
* Support a responsive design for mobile clients
* Constrain scripts to only those pages where they are needed by providing post-level
* configuration flags. For instance, there is a CSS file that is only used on pages with
* syntax highlighting, so that CSS file is only loaded on pages that actually use syntax
* highlighting.
* Support comments (via a separate, optional Hugo module:
[Tinycomments](https://marcusb.org/hacks/tinycomments.html)
* Good image and image gallery support (via a separate, optional Hugo module:
[Tinyimages](https://marcusb.org/hacks/tinyimages.html)

Detailed installation instructions are provided
[here](https://marcusb.org/hacks/tinyblog.html).  The [author's site](https://marcusb.org)
