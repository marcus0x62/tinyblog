## Reporting Security Issues

I take security and privacy issues with my software seriously.  I appreciate any and all
reports of security issues, and offer two primary ways to report an issue:

* [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/marcus0x62/tinyblog/security/advisories/new)
via Github
* Send me an OpenPGP-encrypted [email](mailto:marcusb@marcusb.org).  You can download my
public key [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=marcusb%40marcusb.org)

Both methods will end up in the same place; please use whichever you feel most comfortable
with.

If you aren't sure if an issue you've identified is a "security issue", please err on the side
of reporting! I'd rather have a conversation about why I don't consider something to be a
vulnerability than miss out on the opportunity to improve my software.

I will make every effort to respond to vulnerability reports within 72 hours, but may need
more time to analyze a complicated issue.  Time to deliver a fix will depend on:

* bug/fix complexity
* bug severity

and will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis.

**Please note: I cannot offer a bug bounty or any other consideration for vulnerability
reports at this time.  I will credit your contribution in release notes and any CVEs, at your
discretion.**
